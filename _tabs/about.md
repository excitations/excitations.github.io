## Introduction

Excitations data is measured by neutron or x-ray spectrometers, and gives us direct access to dynamic processes in matter.
The connection of measurement to understanding often requires combining data from multiple spectrometers and input from theoretical modelling.
At present these interfaces tend to be barriers that require special handling and expertise to be overcome, 
hindering the accessibility of multimodal analysis and knowledge extraction.
We hope that by promoting excitations data and analysis standards we can reduce the barriers and improve the throughput and quality
of spectroscopy measurement insights. 

## Our Mission

- **Promote Rigor:** Establish and share best practices for excitation spectroscopy.
- **Encourage Open Standards:** Develop universally accepted data formats and analysis protocols.
- **Foster Collaboration:** Bring together facility and academic scientists and engineers to work toward common standards.
- **Drive Innovation:** Enable seamless interoperability of tools and methodologies across diverse platforms and approaches.

## About the Organization

We focus on ensuring that inelastic scattering data is as accurate, useful, and reproducible as possible. 
Our collective efforts include:

- **Standards Development:** Collaborating to define clear, measurable standards.
- **Data Sharing:** Promoting transparency and openness in how data is collected, stored, and analyzed.
- **Community-Driven Growth:** Building a network where every member contributes to advancing the science of excitations spectroscopy.
